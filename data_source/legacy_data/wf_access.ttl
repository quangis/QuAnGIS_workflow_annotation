To promote sustainable development in the nation's rural areas, you'll estimate access to all-season roads. First, you'll add population and road data and limit your study area to rural regions. Then, you'll create a 2-kilometer buffer around all-season roads and calculate the percentage of the rural population within that buffer.";
